# Movements-Not-Chords
Smartphone instrument for polyphonic motion.
This program uses JythonMusic and the TouchOSC app on a smartphone.

Configure the OSC listener in the program, using an appropriate IP address and port number. Then, in the TouchOSC app on a smartphone, use the LiveControl iPad layout. 
Go to the sixth page. You should see a matrix of red square buttons. 

This project is currently in development. More documentation on the UI layout to come.
